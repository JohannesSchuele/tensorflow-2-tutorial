TensorFlow is an open-source, highly flexible, and very extensible machine learning library, maintained mainly by Google, that can be used in a wide variety of applications, from Deep Learning research to high-performance AI services. Version 2.0 of this framework brought a user-friendlier and cleaner API accompanied by higher performance. At IUST, we are creating a set tutorial to be taught in our Deep Learning courses. These tutorials include **comprehensive** and **in-depth** materials on how to use TensorFlow 2 in practice. Our goal is to provide opinionated tutorials in which we point out the best practices for each use case. Moreover, these materials are created to be used in **self-study** or **taught as a mini-course**.
