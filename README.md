</p>

TensorFlow is an open-source, highly flexible, and very extensible machine learning library, maintained mainly by Google, that can be used in a wide variety of applications, from Deep Learning research to high-performance AI services. Version 2.0 of this framework brought a user-friendlier and cleaner API accompanied by higher performance. At IUST, we are creating a set tutorial to be taught in our Deep Learning courses. These tutorials include **comprehensive** and **in-depth** materials on how to use TensorFlow 2 in practice. Our goal is to provide opinionated tutorials in which we point out the best practices for each use case. Moreover, these materials are created to be used in **self-study** or **taught as a mini-course**.

**How are these tutorials different from other materials on the Internet?**

First, we aim to approach TensorFlow 2.0 from a practical point of view so that you can start using the framework as soon as possible. Secondly, we try to include and use a wide range of information such as TF team talks, API references, and practical experiences in the making of these materials to make it as comprehensive as possible. Thus, the user can enjoy an all-in-one package. Finally, tutorials are organized in an simple-to-complex manner that can benefit many newcomers. Moreover, the assignments that come with these tutorials make them a ready-to-use option in use in special (short) courses.
